## Results by weight

This chart shows the results by weight.
when people order there choices each one is given a value based on how many 
are selected, so if you've picked 5 the top one gets 5 points, 2nd 4 points, etc.

We take these points and add them up right across the survey, not only do we
get a list of what people have chosen but also what they actually think is 
really important. 

This helps you understand really what matters to people.
