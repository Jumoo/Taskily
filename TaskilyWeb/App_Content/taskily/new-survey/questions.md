### Any Questions?

As well as asking people about tasks, you might want
to ask them a few other questions.

Taskily isn't a full on survey tool, so if you want
to get someone's life story, it's probably not the thing to use.

**But**, if you want to ask a few basic things that might help you
work out who finds what important (like age, income, etc) then you
can add them here.

There are four types of question you can add:

- **Free text**, where people can put anything;
- **Number**, where you ask them for a numerical answer;
- **Multiple choice**, where they pick from a list;
- **Yes/no**, where they get a yes/no option.

For all but multiple choice, the question data section doesn't matter. When you pick multiple choice, put each choice on a new line and we will generate the question from that.

**You don't have to ask any questions! If you don't add a question here, then taskily will just skip this part.**
