### Create a survey

From here you can create your very own survey.

Before you start you will need to know:

- what your tasks are going to be, 
- any other questions you think you might want to ask.

Don't worry too much - you can go back and edit your survey
at any time.

To start off, we need to give your survey a name. This is just
for you - other people won't see the name, but it helps you
to identify your survey on your Taskily page.
