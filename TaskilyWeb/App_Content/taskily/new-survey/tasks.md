## Your Tasks

OK, so let's add your tasks to the survey.

Your tasks are the options that people using your survey will choose from.

Put one task on each line, and we will create the tasks.

**Don't forget to select how many tasks you want your users to pick.** Usually, we suggest that you have them pick 5 things, but if you 
don't have many tasks, you might want to go down to 4, or even 3.
