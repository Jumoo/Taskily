## Running a prize draw ##

Running a prize draw will often improve the response rate for your survey.

When the prize draw setting is on, users will see an extra page of the survey (after the questions).

It will display the title and message you choose, and ask them for their name and email address. 

You can then download this list of respondents, and use it to pick the winner of your draw. 


**If you intend to use the list of names for marketing purposes, you need to include terms and conditions and inform the user.**
