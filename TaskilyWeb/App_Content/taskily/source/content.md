## Taskily at source ##

At [Jumoo](http://jumoo.uk/) Everything we do is open source, so if you don't want to run you're surveys on our hostes platform, you can
download the source code, and install it all locally. 

[Download via Github](https://github.com/Jumoo/Taskily)

you will have to make a few tweaks and we will offer support where we can [taskily@jumoo.co.uk](mailto:taskily@jumoo.co.uk) 

If this sounds to scary you should try out the hosted version? It's free for 3 surveys with up to 50 responses, which is enough to give
you a flavour of how Taskily works, and if you decide to use taskily it's only £100 a year, which is probibly cheaper than setting it
all up and hosting it you're self.
