<h3>Taskily tasks</h3>
</div>
<p>
Taskily can ask people what is important to them, so in this survey we ask, what's important in a task survey tool? A good introduction into 
the features of Taskily, and it shows how nice and easy it can be to get one up and running really quickly.

<h3>Top Tasks</h3>
</div>
<p>
Taskily was written to perform "top tasks" surveys. Asking people to rank all the services you offer on
your website is a great way to find out just what people want and why they are visiting.

<h3>U.S. States</h3>

<p>
Taskily doesn't have to be about tasks. You can ask people to pick anything and then put it into order. Taskily will collect the 
results and draw you some nice graphs.
