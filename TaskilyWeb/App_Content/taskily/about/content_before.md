Welcome to the world of taskily
===============================

Taskily is an app that lets you ask questions, but not just any old questions.
Taskily lets you find out what is important to people.

With Taskily you show people a list, get them to pick the most important things
from it and then sort those things into order.

### Why taskily?

Taskily was originally developed to make ruining top task surveys so much
easier.

Top task surveys are when you get all the tasks that a user can perform on your
website, you list them and ask the users to tell you which ones they consider
important.

You can do top tasks surveys using most on-line survey tools, be we always felt
the user experience wasn't quite right. and trying to get the data out was a
real pain.

With taskily we focused on making the experience of filling out the survey as
pain-free as possible, and because we are building a tool for one type of
survey, we've made getting the data out easier too.

### Taskily as a service

The core of taskily is open source, but we realise that setting up servers and
configuring databases isn't for everyone, so we also offer taskily as a service.
