## How can I pay?##
through this site we accept all major credit cards, but if you are stuck in the middle of a large organisation where that is a problem we can arrange purchase orders.

## What happens after a year? ##
A Taskily standard subscription will last twelve months, after which time it will down grade back to a free subscription. 

Because you are unlikely to be running surveys for more than 12 months we don't automatically renew your subscription. we will email you and if you want to carry on paying you can renew through the site. 

## How long will you keep stuff? ##
All your data will be available to download for the length of your subscription. we don't guarantee we will keep data from free subscriptions, at the moment we are looking to clean them down after 6 months of inactivity.
