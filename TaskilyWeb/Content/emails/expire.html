<h2>Your taskily subscription has expired</h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
    You've probibly forgotten all about taskily, but about a year ago you upgraded your 
    account to a standard subscription and that subscription is about to exipre.
</p>
<p>
    When we built taskily, we knew that for many it would be used for a single project
    and then not used again. So we don't expect people to want to renew their subscriptions.
</p>
<p>
    So <strong>We won't be automatically renewing your subscription</strong> and this means 
    <strong>We won't be taking any more money from you</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    For now we are just going to revert your account back to the free version of taskily. 
</p>
<p>
    You won't loose any data, and all you're surveys will still be there. 
    You will not be able to create more than 3 surveys and any surveys with more than 50
    responses will stop accepting responses.
</p>
<p>
    If you still want to use taskily, you can just reapply the subscription and everything
    will carry on as normal.
</p>
<p>
    thanks for using Taskily, 
</p>
<p>
    Kevin, Jumoo.
